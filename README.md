# Project Description

1. I Need a script to take automatically all the date from the table here --> https://zcodesystem.com/scorespredictor/ (Hockey and NHL)

2. Put everything in a excel file (Table 1) that I receive in some ways like email or other ways, you maybe suggest me the best way.

3. Select the lines from Table 1 where a team should win with 4 or more goal so for example 0-4 1-5 etc. AND With "confidence" >69 %

    - The result must go on a Table 2 or another Excel File.

4. All the lines of Table 2 should be AUTOMATICALY send on a Telegram Channel with a Telegram Bot that autopublish every line of the Table 2, everyday at the same hour .

    - So usually Table 2 on excel should have 4-5 lines because every line must respect the conditions ( Confidence > 69% and goal difference >3 )
